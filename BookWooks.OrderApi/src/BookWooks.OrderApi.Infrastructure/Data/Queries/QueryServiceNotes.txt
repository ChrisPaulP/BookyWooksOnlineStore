Using FromSqlRaw in Entity Framework Core allows you to execute raw SQL queries directly against the database. The benefits of using FromSqlRaw in the provided code snippet include:

Customized Queries: It allows you to write complex SQL queries that might not be expressible with LINQ syntax alone. In your case, you're performing an inner join between the Orders and OrderItems tables, selecting specific columns, and transforming the result into a DTO (Data Transfer Object) representation.

Performance Optimization: For complex queries, writing raw SQL might offer better performance compared to LINQ queries generated by Entity Framework Core. It can be particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when performance optimization is critical.

Flexibility: Raw SQL queries provide more flexibility in terms of crafting queries with specific optimizations or using database-specific features that might not be available through LINQ.

Mapping to DTOs: You can directly map the result of the raw SQL query to your DTO (Data Transfer Object) model. This can be efficient in scenarios where you want to shape the data in a specific way for consumption by your application's front end or other layers.

Reduced Overhead: Since you're selecting only the required columns from the database, there's reduced overhead in terms of data transfer between the database and the application.

However, it's worth noting that using FromSqlRaw bypasses some of Entity Framework Core's features, such as change tracking and some query optimizations. Additionally, it can make your application more dependent on the underlying database schema, potentially reducing portability between different database providers. So, it's essential to weigh these considerations based on your specific requirements and performance considerations.
